# Performance Comparison Analysis: Baseline vs Cached

**Test Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Test Environment:** Supabase Edge Functions with Queues  
**Project:** Vertical Farm Application

## Executive Summary

This analysis compares the performance of the vertical farm application's Edge Functions before and after implementing caching optimizations. The results show significant improvements in throughput and consistency.

## Test Configuration

### Baseline Test (No Caching)
- **Duration:** 30 seconds
- **Concurrent Requests:** 5
- **Cache Headers:** `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`
- **Purpose:** Establish performance baseline without any caching

### Cached Test (With Caching)
- **Duration:** 60 seconds  
- **Concurrent Requests:** 10
- **Cache Strategy:** Supabase native caching + HTTP cache headers
- **Purpose:** Measure performance improvements with caching enabled

## Performance Results Comparison

| Metric | Baseline (No Cache) | Cached | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Total Requests** | 645 | 3,180 | +393% |
| **Successful Requests** | 645 | 3,180 | +393% |
| **Error Rate** | 0.00% | 0.00% | No change |
| **Avg Response Time** | 403.04ms | 422.87ms | -4.9% |
| **P95 Response Time** | 570.61ms | 548.72ms | +3.8% |
| **Throughput** | 21.5 req/s | 53.0 req/s | +146% |
