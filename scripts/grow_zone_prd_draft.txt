Here’s a first draft of your PRD for a Home Assistant community add‑on to control a vertical farming environment.

This add‑on will leverage Home Assistant’s Supervisor add‑on model—running as a container managed by the Supervisor—and a custom integration (in custom_components) to provide YAML‑driven configuration, service APIs, and a companion Lovelace card for monitoring and control. It solves the problem of fragmented, hardware‑specific farming automation by providing a unified, flexible platform for growers of all scales, from hobbyists to small commercial farms, to schedule and orchestrate lighting, irrigation, climate, and nutrient delivery—all within Home Assistant’s familiar UI.

# Overview 

Add‑ons allow users to extend Home Assistant’s functionality by running applications as container images managed by the Supervisor panel :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. This community add‑on targets vertical farming environments—automating lighting, irrigation, climate (temperature, humidity), and nutrient delivery in stacked grow racks—to deliver precise, resource‑efficient crop management year‑round :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. By embedding both the control logic (in a Docker container) and a Home Assistant integration (in `custom_components`), it unifies hardware‑agnostic scheduling, real‑time monitoring, and notifications under one roof :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

Core Features 
Multi‑Zone Scheduling
What it does: Define unlimited controllers, zones, and schedules (time‑ or sun‑event‑based, cron expressions, weekday/month filters) 
Why it’s important: Supports complex watering/nutrient cycles and lighting shifts without messy scripts 
How it works: YAML schema describes controllers ▶️ zones ▶️ schedules; the integration translates these to binary sensors and service calls.

Sequence and Cycle Management
What it does: Create sequences (“playlists”) to run zones in order with configurable delays for soak‑and‑drain eco cycles 
Why it’s important: Optimizes water usage and prevents hydraulic shock in pneumatic or solenoid valves.
How it works: Sequence objects group schedules/zones, with delay parameters applied automatically.

Real‑Time Monitoring & History
What it does: Exposes binary sensors for controllers and zones, with attributes for current schedule, next run time, and runtime history 
Why it’s important: Enables growers to track performance and troubleshoot issues without leaving Home Assistant.
How it works: Custom integration collects state and emits events (irrigation_unlimited_start, irrigation_unlimited_finish) for automations.

Companion Lovelace Card
What it does: Provides a dashboard card showing upcoming schedules, history, and manual run controls 
Why it’s important: Offers intuitive, in‑UI control and status overview without custom Grafana dashboards.
How it works: Card is a TypeScript widget installed alongside the integration; it subscribes to sensor entities and service calls.

Hardware‑Independent Control
What it does: Works with any Home Assistant entity supporting turn_on/turn_off (switch, light, cover, etc.) 
Why it’s important: Ensures compatibility across relays, motorized valves, ESPHome boards, or commercial controllers.
How it works: Controllers/zones map to entity IDs; service calls trigger the corresponding entity.

User Experience 🧑‍💻

User Personas

Hobbyist Grower: Seeks simple scheduling for a single tent or mini vertical farm.
Commercial Micro‑farm Manager: Requires fine‑grained control of multiple zones, eco‑cycles, and historical data.
Researcher/Developer: Integrates weather or ML‑based run‑time adjustments via Home Assistant automations.

Key User Flows

Installation via HACS or local add‑ons folder, then enable in Supervisor 
Home Assistant
.

Configuration by editing configuration.yaml (controllers ▶️ zones ▶️ schedules), reload integration without restart 
GitHub
.

Monitoring & Control using the Lovelace card: view upcoming runs, manual start/stop, history graphs.

Automation Extensions: Link sensor data (e.g., soil moisture, external weather) to adjust_time service calls for dynamic control.

UI/UX Considerations

Responsive Card Design: Mobile‑first layout with collapsible controllers and zones.

Accessibility: Clear labeling, high‑contrast icons, and keyboard navigation support.

Customization: Support theming via Lovelace options; allow hiding inactive controllers.

# Technical Architecture 

- **Add‑On Container**: Based on Alpine Linux; defined by `Dockerfile` with labels `io.hass.type="addon"` and `io.hass.arch` per architecture requirements :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. - **Supervisor Integration**: Repository structured per Home Assistant Developer Docs for add‑ons—`config.json`, `Dockerfile`, `run.sh`, and `options_schema.yaml` for Supervisor UI configuration :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. - **Custom Integration**: Lives in `custom_components/vertical_farm`, using Python to parse YAML, register service calls, entities, and events (mirroring Irrigation Unlimited’s architecture) :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}. - **Data Models**: - Controllers ▶️ zones ▶️ schedules, sequences; each mapped to binary sensors. - Attributes include name, entity_id, next run, duration, history. - **APIs & Integrations**: - **Home Assistant Services**: `vertical_farm.run`, `vertical_farm.adjust_time`. - **Events**: `vertical_farm_start`, `vertical_farm_finish` for hookable automations. - **Third‑Party**: Optional MQTT bridge, ESPHome sensors, weather integrations for dynamic adjustments. - **Infrastructure Requirements**: - Home Assistant OS/Supervised install with Supervisor panel. - Hardware: Any switchable device (GPIO, Zigbee/Z‑Wave relays, ESPHome). - Network: LAN connectivity for local sensors and optional cloud backup.

Development Roadmap 🚀

Phase 1 (MVP)

Build add‑on scaffolding: Dockerfile, config.json, Supervisor metadata.
Develop core integration: parse YAML, register controllers/zones, basic scheduling engine.
Expose binary sensors and implement manual run service calls.

Phase 2 (Enhancements)

Add sequences/cycles (delays, eco‑mode) and schedule filters (sun events, cron).
Create companion Lovelace card and service shim for input controls.
Implement history tracking and basic charts via Home Assistant statistics.

Phase 3 (Advanced Features)

Auto‑adjust run times based on sensor inputs (ET calculations, weather forecasts) 
Integrate machine‑learning suggestions for optimal crop cycles.
Publish to HACS with documentation, tests, and community feedback loop.

Logical Dependency Chain 🔗

Foundation: Set up add‑on repository, Docker build, Supervisor metadata.
Integration Core: YAML schema, Python service handlers, entity registration.
Basic Scheduling: Implement time/event triggers and runtime engine.
First‑Usable UI: Expose binary sensors and test manual runs via Services page.
Lovelace Card: Build and refine UI widget for production‑ready display.
Advanced Modules: Sequences, history, dynamic adjustments layered on core.

Risks and Mitigations ⚠️

Technical Complexity:
Risk: Diverse hardware leads to inconsistencies.
Mitigation: Abstract control via Home Assistant entity layer; extensive integration tests.

MVP Scope Creep:
Risk: Feature overload delays usable release.
Mitigation: Strict phase‑based feature gating; freeze core before enhancements.

Resource Constraints:

Risk: Limited contributor bandwidth.
Mitigation: Document architecture clearly; encourage community contributions once MVP is stable.
