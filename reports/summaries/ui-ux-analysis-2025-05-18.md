## Heuristic & Accessibility Findings

### Landing Page
- **Color Contrast:** Sufficient for most elements, but verify contrast for secondary text and buttons (WCAG 2.2 AA).
- **Layout Alignment:** Clean, grid-based layout. No major misalignments.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear call-to-action ("Go to Dashboard"). Good use of headings and subtext.
- **Button Affordance:** Primary CTA is prominent. Secondary links (GitHub, Docs) are less visually distinct.
- **Text Legibility:** Font size and weight are readable. Consider increasing contrast for footer text.
- **Navigation Clarity:** Top nav is clear, but could benefit from active state highlighting.
- **Feedback/Errors:** No visible feedback or error states on this screen.
- **Motion/Animation:** No distracting motion observed.

### Login Page
- **Color Contrast:** Sufficient for form fields and buttons. Check "Remember me" and "Forgot password?" for contrast.
- **Layout Alignment:** Well-aligned form. Social login buttons are clear.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Login CTA is clear. Social logins are visually separated.
- **Button Affordance:** Good. All buttons look clickable.
- **Text Legibility:** Good, but "Don't have an account? Sign Up" could be more prominent.
- **Navigation Clarity:** Clear path to sign up and password recovery.
- **Feedback/Errors:** No error states visible (test with invalid input recommended).
- **Motion/Animation:** None observed.

### Dashboard/Profile/About/Home Pages
- **Color Contrast:** Consistent with other screens. Ensure all text meets contrast standards.
- **Layout Alignment:** Consistent nav and content alignment.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Dashboard and Profile lack strong visual hierarchyâ€”consider larger headings or section dividers.
- **Button Affordance:** Some links/buttons (e.g., nav) could use hover/active states for clarity.
- **Text Legibility:** Good overall.
- **Navigation Clarity:** Navigation is persistent and clear, but active state is missing.
- **Feedback/Errors:** No feedback or error states visible.
- **Motion/Animation:** No distracting motion.

| About         |      85        |     82     |      86       |       80         |       83        |
| Home          |      90        |     85     |      88       |       92         |       90        |

**Scoring Rationale:**
- High marks for clean layout, consistent color palette, and readable typography.
- Lower scores for dashboard/profile due to lack of strong visual hierarchy and feedback states.
