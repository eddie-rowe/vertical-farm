## Heuristic & Accessibility Findings

### 1. Visibility of System Status
- ✅ Clear feedback on login errors and loading states.
- ⚠️ No visible progress indicator after login (recommend adding a spinner or progress bar).

### 2. Match Between System & Real World
- ✅ Uses familiar terms ("Dashboard", "Settings").
- ⚠️ Some icons lack text labels, which may confuse new users.

### 3. User Control & Freedom
- ✅ "Forgot Password" and "Sign Up" links are present.
- ⚠️ No visible "Log out" button on dashboard (may be hidden in a menu).

### 4. Consistency & Standards
- ✅ Consistent color palette and button styles.
- ⚠️ Some navigation elements are only visible on certain viewports.

### 5. Error Prevention
- ✅ Login form disables submit until fields are filled.
- ⚠️ No password visibility toggle on login form.

### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
- ✅ Navigation is sidebar-based on desktop, but not always visible on mobile.
- ⚠️ Consider persistent bottom nav for mobile.

### 7. Flexibility & Efficiency of Use
- ⚠️ No keyboard shortcuts or quick actions observed.

### 8. Aesthetic & Minimalist Design
- ✅ Clean, modern design with good whitespace.
- ⚠️ Some text contrast is low (see below).

### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
- ✅ Error messages are present for login failures.
- ⚠️ No inline field validation for password strength or email format.

### 10. Help & Documentation
- ⚠️ No visible help or onboarding tooltips for new users.

---

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.1) Checks
- ⚠️ **Contrast:** Some gray text on white background is below 4.5:1 ratio (e.g., placeholder text, secondary labels).
- ⚠️ **Touch Targets:** Some buttons/links (e.g., "Forgot Password") are smaller than 44x44px on mobile.
- ✅ **Keyboard Navigation:** Login form is keyboard accessible.
- ⚠️ **Alt Text:** Logo images have alt attributes, but some icons may lack descriptive alt text.

### Dashboard Desktop
- Sidebar navigation is clear, but icons lack labels.

## Actionable Recommendations

1. **Improve Contrast:**
   - Increase contrast for secondary text and links to meet WCAG AA (4.5:1).
2. **Add Password Visibility Toggle:**
   - Allow users to view/hide password on login.
3. **Persistent Navigation on Mobile:**
   - Add a bottom nav bar or hamburger menu for easier access.
4. **Touch Target Size:**
   - Ensure all interactive elements are at least 44x44px on mobile.
5. **Inline Validation:**
   - Add real-time validation for email and password fields.
6. **Help & Onboarding:**
   - Provide tooltips or a help section for new users.
7. **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   - Consider adding shortcuts for power users.
