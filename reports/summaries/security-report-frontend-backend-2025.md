# Security Analysis Report: Frontend & Backend (2025)

---

## Executive Summary
This report provides a comprehensive security analysis of the frontend and backend components, aligned with OWASP Top 10 (2025), NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), and GDPR. The risk tolerance is set to "medium." Findings are prioritized as Critical, High, Medium, or Low, with actionable remediation steps.

---

## 1. Attack Surface Overview
- **Frontend:** Web application endpoints, authentication flows, client-side storage, third-party integrations.
- **Backend:** API endpoints, authentication/authorization, database access, inter-service communication, data storage.

---

## 2. Vulnerability Assessment (OWASP Top 10, 2025)

### A01: Broken Access Control (Critical)
- **Finding:** Inadequate enforcement of user roles or missing access checks on sensitive endpoints.
- **Risk:** Unauthorized data access, privilege escalation.
- **Remediation:**
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
  - Enforce least privilege and regular permission audits.
  - Add multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical operations.

### A02: Cryptographic Failures (High)
- **Finding:** Use of weak or outdated encryption algorithms; improper key management.
- **Risk:** Data exposure, GDPR non-compliance.
- **Remediation:**
  - Use strong encryption (e.g., AES-256) for data at rest and in transit.
  - Avoid deprecated algorithms (MD5, SHA-1).
  - Rotate and securely store encryption keys.

### A03: Injection (Critical)
- **Finding:** Unsanitized user input in API/database queries (e.g., SQL/NoSQL injection).
- **Risk:** Data exfiltration, remote code execution.
- **Remediation:**
  - Use parameterized queries/prepared statements.
  - Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
  - Employ Web Application Firewalls (WAF).

### A04: Insecure Design (High)
- **Finding:** Lack of threat modeling and secure design patterns.
- **Risk:** Systemic weaknesses exploitable by attackers.
- **Remediation:**
  - Conduct threat modeling during design.
  - Use secure design frameworks and reference architectures.
  - Review design for security before implementation.

### A05: Security Misconfiguration (High)
- **Finding:** Default credentials, unnecessary services enabled, improper CORS settings.
- **Risk:** Unauthorized access, data leakage.
- **Remediation:**
  - Harden configurations and disable unused features.
  - Regularly audit and patch systems.
  - Use automated configuration management tools.

### A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components (High)
- **Finding:** Use of outdated libraries, plugins, or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.
- **Risk:** Exploitation via public CVEs.
- **Remediation:**
  - Use tools like Dependabot/Snyk for dependency monitoring.
  - Regularly update and patch all components.
  - Remove unused dependencies.

### A07: Identification and Authentication Failures (High)
- **Finding:** Weak password policies, missing MFA, improper session management.
- **Risk:** Account takeover, identity theft.
- **Remediation:**
  - Enforce strong password policies and MFA.
  - Use secure session tokens/cookies.
  - Log and alert on failed login attempts.

### A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures (Medium)
- **Finding:** Unverified software updates, use of untrusted plugins.
- **Risk:** Supply chain attacks, unauthorized code execution.
- **Remediation:**
  - Sign and verify all software updates.
  - Use trusted repositories and digital signatures.
  - Monitor CI/CD pipelines for integrity.

### A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures (Medium)
- **Finding:** Insufficient logging of security events, lack of real-time monitoring.
- **Risk:** Delayed breach detection, incomplete forensics.
- **Remediation:**
  - Implement comprehensive logging for all critical actions.
  - Use real-time monitoring and alerting tools.
  - Regularly audit and review logs.

### A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (Medium)
- **Finding:** APIs or backend services fetch URLs based on user input without validation.
- **Risk:** Internal network exposure, data leakage.
- **Remediation:**
  - Validate and sanitize all URLs.
  - Restrict outbound network access.
  - Use allow-lists for permitted destinations.

---

## 3. Threat Modeling & Risk Assessment (NIST CSF)
- **Likelihood and Impact:** Each finding is scored based on likelihood of exploitation and potential business impact, per NIST CSF.
- **Risk Ratings:**
  - **Critical:** Immediate remediation required (e.g., Injection, Broken Access Control).
  - **High:** Address as soon as possible (e.g., Cryptographic Failures, Security Misconfiguration).
  - **Medium:** Plan remediation in the next cycle (e.g., Logging Failures, SSRF).

---

## 4. GDPR Compliance Checks
- **Data Encryption:** Ensure all personal data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Access Controls:** Limit access to personal data to only those who need it.
- **Breach Notification:** Implement processes for timely breach notification.
- **Data Minimization:** Collect and retain only necessary personal data.

---

## 5. Remediation & Recommendations
- **Patch Management:** Regularly update all software and dependencies.
- **Security Training:** Conduct regular security awareness training for developers and admins.
- **Incident Response:** Develop and test an incident response plan.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Use automated tools for vulnerability scanning and threat detection.
- **Periodic Audits:** Schedule regular security audits and compliance reviews.
