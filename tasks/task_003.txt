# Task ID: 3
# Title: Home Assistant Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement WebSocket and REST API integration with Home Assistant to enable device control and sensor monitoring.
# Details:
1. Create a Home Assistant client service in FastAPI:
   ```python
   class HomeAssistantClient:
       def __init__(self, base_url, access_token):
           self.base_url = base_url
           self.headers = {
               "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
               "Content-Type": "application/json"
           }
           self.websocket = None
       
       async def connect_websocket(self):
           # WebSocket connection logic
           pass
           
       async def get_entities(self, entity_type=None):
           # Fetch entities from Home Assistant
           pass
           
       async def call_service(self, domain, service, entity_id, data=None):
           # Control devices via service calls
           pass
   ```
2. Implement WebSocket subscription to sensor and device states
3. Create endpoints in FastAPI to proxy Home Assistant API:
   - GET /api/ha/entities - List all entities
   - GET /api/ha/entities/{entity_id} - Get entity details
   - POST /api/ha/services/{domain}/{service} - Call a service
4. Add authentication and connection management
5. Implement error handling and reconnection logic
6. Create a background task for maintaining WebSocket connection
7. Add caching layer for entity states to reduce API calls

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with mocked Home Assistant responses. Integration tests with a test Home Assistant instance. Test WebSocket reconnection on connection loss. Verify entity state updates are received in real-time. Test service calls for device control.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Client Service Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a client service layer that abstracts the communication with external systems
### Details:
Implement a service class that handles both WebSocket and REST communication patterns. Include connection management, serialization/deserialization of payloads, and retry logic for failed connections.

## 2. WebSocket Connection Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement WebSocket connection handling for real-time data updates
### Details:
Develop WebSocket client implementation with connection lifecycle management (connect, disconnect, reconnect), heartbeat mechanism, and incremental update processing to reduce bandwidth usage.

## 3. REST API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop REST endpoint integration for non-real-time operations
### Details:
Create REST client with appropriate request/response handling, implement API versioning support, and develop serialization/deserialization for various data formats.

## 4. Authentication System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Implement secure authentication for both WebSocket and REST connections
### Details:
Develop authentication mechanisms including token management, credential storage, refresh token handling, and session maintenance across both connection types.

## 5. Error Handling and Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Create robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
### Details:
Implement comprehensive error handling including connection failures, authentication errors, data validation issues, and automatic recovery procedures with exponential backoff.

## 6. Background Processing System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Develop background task processing for asynchronous operations
### Details:
Create a background job system to handle long-running tasks, implement queuing mechanisms, and develop retry policies for failed background operations.

## 7. Caching Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.5
### Description: Implement efficient caching for frequently accessed data
### Details:
Develop a caching layer using Redis or in-memory storage, implement cache invalidation strategies, and create mechanisms for dynamically adjusting cache policies based on usage patterns.

## 8. Integration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7
### Description: Create comprehensive test suite for the integration
### Details:
Develop integration tests covering all components, implement performance benchmarks to measure efficiency, create mocks for external dependencies, and establish continuous integration pipeline.
