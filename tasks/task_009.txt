# Task ID: 9
# Title: Role-Based Access Control
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement role-based access control using Supabase Auth to differentiate between Farm Managers, Operators, and Home Assistant Power Users.
# Details:
1. Define user roles and permissions:
   ```sql
   CREATE TYPE user_role AS ENUM ('farm_manager', 'operator', 'ha_power_user');
   
   CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
     role user_role NOT NULL DEFAULT 'operator',
     name TEXT,
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile"
     ON user_profiles FOR SELECT
     USING (auth.uid() = id);
   
   CREATE POLICY "Farm managers can view all profiles"
     ON user_profiles FOR SELECT
     USING (EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles
       WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'farm_manager'
     ));
   ```
2. Implement authentication UI components:
   - LoginForm
   - RegistrationForm
   - UserProfileForm
   - RoleManagementPanel
3. Create protected routes in Next.js based on user roles
4. Implement API endpoint authorization in FastAPI
5. Add user invitation system
6. Create audit logging for sensitive operations
7. Implement session management and timeout

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for authentication components and authorization logic. Integration tests with Supabase Auth. Test access control for different user roles. Verify protected routes are properly secured. Test user invitation and registration flow.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define App Roles and Permission Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Map out application roles, resources, and actions to create a comprehensive RBAC schema
### Details:
Analyze application needs, define role hierarchy, identify protected resources, and specify permitted actions for each role. Document the complete permission matrix that will serve as the foundation for the entire RBAC implementation.

## 2. Implement Authentication UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create user interface elements for authentication flow
### Details:
Design and implement login, registration, password reset, and multi-factor authentication screens. Ensure proper validation, error handling, and accessibility compliance across all authentication interfaces.

## 3. Set Up Protected Routes [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Configure route protection based on user roles and permissions
### Details:
Implement middleware or guards that verify user authentication and authorization before allowing access to protected routes. Create redirect logic for unauthorized access attempts and handle role-based navigation restrictions.

## 4. Develop API Authorization Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build backend authorization mechanisms to secure API endpoints
### Details:
Create middleware to validate access tokens, extract role information, and enforce permission checks on API endpoints. Implement proper error responses for unauthorized requests and ensure consistent authorization across all API resources.

## 5. Create User Invitation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Build functionality for inviting users with predefined roles
### Details:
Develop email invitation workflow with secure token generation, role assignment during invitation, and account activation process. Include admin interfaces for managing invitations and tracking invitation status.

## 6. Implement Audit Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Set up comprehensive logging for all access control events
### Details:
Create logging infrastructure to record authentication attempts, authorization decisions, role changes, and resource access. Design log storage, retention policies, and admin interfaces for reviewing security events.

## 7. Develop Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.4
### Description: Implement secure session handling with role-aware capabilities
### Details:
Build session creation, validation, and expiration mechanisms. Implement token refresh logic, concurrent session handling, and forced logout capabilities. Ensure sessions maintain and respect role information throughout their lifecycle.
