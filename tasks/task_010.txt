# Task ID: 10
# Title: Harvest Logging and Yield Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a mobile-friendly UI for operators to log harvests and track yields, with data synchronization to the main system.
# Details:
1. Create UI components for harvest logging:
   - HarvestEntryForm
   - YieldTracker
   - HarvestHistory
   - BatchLabelGenerator
2. Implement responsive design for mobile use
3. Create FastAPI endpoints for harvest data:
   ```python
   @app.post("/api/harvests")
   async def create_harvest(harvest: HarvestCreate, user=Depends(get_current_user)):
       # Validate and store harvest data
       return await harvest_service.create_harvest(harvest, user.id)
   
   @app.get("/api/harvests")
   async def list_harvests(shelf_id: Optional[str] = None, user=Depends(get_current_user)):
       # Retrieve harvest history with optional filtering
       return await harvest_service.list_harvests(user.id, shelf_id)
   ```
4. Add offline support with local storage
5. Implement data synchronization when connection is restored
6. Create barcode/QR code scanning for shelf identification
7. Add photo upload capability for harvest documentation
8. Implement yield comparison against recipe expectations

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for harvest logging components and validation. Integration tests for harvest data storage and retrieval. Test offline functionality and data synchronization. Verify mobile responsiveness on various device sizes. Test barcode scanning and photo upload features.
