# Task ID: 8
# Title: Historical Analytics and Reporting
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a system for visualizing historical data, yield history, and performance metrics to help refine growing practices.
# Details:
1. Design database schema for historical data:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE sensor_history (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
     entity_id TEXT NOT NULL,
     value NUMERIC NOT NULL,
     timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   
   CREATE TABLE harvests (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
     shelf_id UUID REFERENCES shelves(id),
     schedule_id UUID REFERENCES schedules(id),
     yield_amount NUMERIC NOT NULL,
     harvest_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     notes TEXT
   );
   ```
2. Implement data retention policy and aggregation for sensor data
3. Create FastAPI endpoints for historical data retrieval
4. Develop UI components for analytics:
   - TimeSeriesChart
   - YieldComparisonChart
   - PerformanceMetricsPanel
   - ReportGenerator
5. Implement date range filtering
6. Add export functionality (CSV, PDF)
7. Create scheduled report generation
8. Implement performance metrics calculation (yield per shelf, resource efficiency)

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for chart components and data aggregation. Integration tests for historical data retrieval. Test data export functionality. Verify metrics calculations are accurate. Test report generation with various parameters.
