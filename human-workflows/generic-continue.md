# A generic prompt to move forward with task-master

Call task-master to work through the project plan, 
one subtask at a time, and use your best judgement to complete the task. 

Crawl through as many project files as you need to gain context along your path. 
I trust you to make wise decisions to complete the project. Carry on brave soldier.

I trust you will act with wisdom and best practices 
that put UI and UX at the center - please proceed.
