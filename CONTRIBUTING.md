## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Grabbing a task

1. Go to the [Vertical Farm Project Page](https://github.com/users/eddie-rowe/projects/6)

2. Browse tasks in the `Ready` column. 

3. When you have decided on the task you'd like to work on, click on the task and fill out the following fields on the right sidebar.
   1. `Assignee:` Your GitHub username
   2. `Projects:` Set status to `In Progress`

4. In the `Development` section on the task's right sidebar, click the blue `Create a branch` link
   1. `Branch Name:` Leave as the auto-generated name
   2. `Repository destination:` eddie-rowe/vertical-farm
   3. `Branch source:` main
   4. `What's next?:` checkout locally
   5. Click the green `Create Branch` button

5. In Cursor, verify you are on your new branch
    ```bash
    git status
    ```

### 2. Planning the work

1. Ask the Cursor AI agent to evaluate for completion with this prompt:

```markdown
You are a senior full stack software developer.
Your task is to:
1. Use GitHub MCP server to analyze [ISSUE ##]
2. Plan its implementation by breaking it down into smaller, ordered subtasks.
3. Ensure the full stack implications are considered.
4. Create the final output in this table format:
SUBTASK | DETAILS | REASONING | COMPLEXITY | ETC

Call sequential thinking MCP server to perform your task.
Call context7 MCP server to retrieve relevant up to date dcoumentation when necessary.
```

- Review the returned ISSUE TASK breakdown. Modify where required/desired.
- Use the Cursor AI Agent to update your issue [ISSUE ##] with the subtask breakdown using GitHub MCP server.

### 3. Doing the work

- Systematically perform these subtasks with the Cursor AI agent.
- - **Update issue status** as you progress
- When complete, ask the Cursor AI agent to evaluate for completion with this prompt:

```markdown
You are a senior full stack code reviewer.

Your task is to...

Call sequential thinking MCP server to perform your task.
Call context7 MCP server to retrieve relevant up to date dcoumentation when necessary.
```

- Many of the code standards below are implemented when using this project's Cursor Rules. As long as you're coding with Cursor's AI agent, you don't have to spend many of your thinking cycles on these:
- **Frontend:** Follow existing React/TypeScript patterns
- **Backend:** Follow FastAPI/Python conventions
- **Database:** Use Supabase migrations for schema changes
- **Tests:** Write tests for new functionality


### 4. üß™ Testing the work

- AI Agent prompt
- Human Workflow

    ```bash
    # Start development environment
    docker-compose up -d

    # Stop services
    docker-compose down

    # Rebuild containers (after dependency changes)
    docker-compose up -d --build

    # View running services
    docker-compose ps
    ```

- Running Tests with Docker

    ```bash
    # Run all tests
    docker-compose exec backend pytest
    docker-compose exec frontend npm test

    # Run specific test suites
    docker-compose exec backend pytest tests/unit/
    docker-compose exec backend pytest tests/integration/
    docker-compose exec frontend npm run test:e2e

    # Type checking
    docker-compose exec backend pyright
    docker-compose exec frontend npm run type-check
    ```

- Manual Testing

    ```bash
    # Access the running application
    # Frontend: http://localhost:3000
    # Backend API: http://localhost:8000
    # API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

    # View logs for debugging
    docker-compose logs -f frontend
    docker-compose logs -f backend
    ```

- GitHub Actions workflows
  - main pipeline
  - testing components
  - in-line style guide AI reviewer (docs/ only)
  - in-line code quality AI reviewer (frontend/ and backend/)
  - in-line UI/UX AI reviewer (frontend/ only)

### 5. Committing the work

- Commit changes to your branch and create a draft PR
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "[ISSUE##] Implement this rad new feature"
    git push
    ```

-  **Link PRs** to issues using `Closes #123`
  
1. **Create PR** with descriptive title and description
2. **Reference issues** in PR description (`Closes #123`)
3. **Request review** from the other developer
4. **Address feedback** and update as needed
5. **Merge** after approval

### 6. Review phase

- this happens

## üë• Collaboration Guidelines

- **Shared responsibilities** (code reviews, testing, documentation)

### Communication
- **Update issues** with progress comments
- **Tag team members** when you need input (`@username`)
- **Ask questions early** - don't get stuck for too long
- **Share learnings** - document discoveries for the team

### Code Review
- **Always review each other's work**
- **Be constructive** in feedback
- **Test changes** before approving
- **Check for security** and performance implications

### Thinking at scale
- **Serving each other** by suggesting automated workflows
- **Quality** and **Clarity**
- **How will what I do add value to users or developers?**


## üìö Documentation

5. **Document** - what happened and how it was fixed

### Getting Help
- **Check existing issues** for similar problems
- **Search documentation** for solutions
- **Ask the team** - we're here to help
- **Use debugging tools** - browser dev tools, logs

## üéØ Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- **Follow existing patterns** - consistency is key
- **Write readable code** - others need to understand it
- **Handle errors gracefully** - don't let things crash
- **Optimize for performance** - especially for IoT data

### Security
- **Validate all inputs** - frontend and backend
- **Use environment variables** for secrets
- **Follow authentication** patterns
- **Test security** for new features

### Performance
- **Monitor response times** - especially API calls
- **Optimize database queries** - use indexes
- **Implement caching** where appropriate
- **Test with real data** - not just small datasets

## üìù Commit Guidelines

### Commit Messages
```
type(scope): description

Examples:
