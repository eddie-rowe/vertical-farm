Create a new feature in vertical-farm called "Integrations" - I would like the first integration to be with Home Assistant so users can control various device types and assign them to rows, racks, and shelves within the vertical-farm app.

1. Primary purpose of the vertical-farm application: Control and manage a small-scale vertical farm
2. Specific device types to be controlled: lights, water fill solenoids, water drain solenoids, fans - all represented as switches in home assistant.
3. How users will interact with assigned devices: They will assign them to their respective rows, racks, and shelves within the vertical farm. They will be able to control them manually, see their current state, and have automations/schedules control them.
More information about home assistant devices:

Devices are represented in Home Assistant as entities. The state of an entity (for example, if a light is on, at 50% brightness in orange) can be shown on the dashboard or be used in automations. This page looks at the concepts state, state object, and entity state attribute.

The state object represents the state of an entity with its attributes at a specific point in time. All state objects will always have an entity id, a state, and timestamps when last updated, last changed, and last reported. The state prefix indicates that this information is part of the state object (which is related to the entity). For example, state.state is the state of the entity at a given time.

These types of automations are envisioned for future features, not this one:
time-based schedules, conditional triggers, cross-device interactions, logging
