## Security Overview

The vertical-farm application implements comprehensive security measures:
- Authentication and authorization via Supabase Auth
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- HTTPS/TLS encryption for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular security audits and testing

## Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege** - Minimal access rights for users and systems
3. **Zero Trust** - Verify every request and user
4. **Security by Design** - Security built into the architecture
5. **Continuous Monitoring** - Ongoing security assessment

## Threat Model

Key threats addressed:
- Unauthorized data access
- SQL injection attacks
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Authentication bypass
- Data breaches
- API abuse

## Quick Start

1. Review [model.md](./model.md) for security architecture overview
2. Check security policies in [policies/](./policies/)
3. Review compliance documentation in [compliance/](./compliance/)

## Security Testing

Regular security testing includes:
- Vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing
- Code security reviews
- Dependency audits
