# 1. Overview

A dedicated HACS integration that brings all vertical-farm concerns under Home Assistant’s roof:

- **Layout & Devices**: Model physical racks, shelves, rows, sensors and actuators.
- **Recipes & Schedules**: Per-species grow recipes (watering, lighting, days in light).
- **Automation & UI**: Blueprint-driven automations, custom Lovelace cards for visualization and control.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Historical data, yield tracking, resource usage, and exportable reports.
- **Extensibility**: Plugin hooks for new hardware, vision-based monitoring, business-system integrations.

By leveraging Home Assistant’s open-source ecosystem, we deliver local-first privacy and immediate community updates via HACS.

# 2. Value Proposition

## 2.1 For Home Growers & Hobbyists

- **DIY-Friendly**: Turn a Raspberry Pi + ESPHome nodes into a modular microfarm in an afternoon.
- **Blueprint Templates**: One-click automations shareable via HACS (e.g. “Microgreens Flood & Drain”).

## 2.2 For Small Commercial & Urban Farms

- **Consistency & Traceability**: Central logs and dashboards help meet safety/quality audits.
- **Resource Optimization**: Automations tuned to minimize water/electricity while maximizing yield.

## 2.3 For AgTech Integrators & Developers

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Publish new device drivers, vision modules, ML-powered controls independently.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Containerized add-ons + optional cloud sync for multi-site roll-out.

## 2.4 For Researchers & Educators

- **Open Data Access**: Native Home Assistant stats + Grafana/ML pipelines enable experiments.
- **Reproducible Testbeds**: Share full farm-control stacks via HACS repositories.

# 4. Core Features

Each feature is defined for clarity to an AI task-planner:

## 4.1 Farm Layout & Configuration

- **What**: UI forms to define farms → rows → racks → shelves.  
- **Why**: Establishes the entity hierarchy for all subsequent mappings.  

## 4.2 Device Assignment

- **What**: Assign lights, pumps, fans, sensors, etc to physical locations.  
- **Why**: Enables per-shelf control and data collection.  
- **How**: Use Home Assistant’s `entity_registry` and custom domain `vertical_farm.device`.

## 4.3 Grow Recipes & Scheduling

- **What**: Per-species recipes (e.g., “Arugula - 15g seed per tray - avg yield 200g - flood solenoid on for 1 min @ 08:00, drain solenoids on for 10 min @ 8:05, lights on 16 h, repeat for 6 days”).  
- **Why**: Automate routine tasks and capture best-practice protocols.  
- **How**: Blueprint templates + `vertical_farm.recipe` integrations → scheduled automations.
- **Note**: Mechanism to ensure only one shelf is being watered at a time due to water pressure.

## 4.4 Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts

- **What**: Live dashboards for temp/humidity/pH/CO₂, plus threshold alerts.  
- **Why**: Early detection of anomalies prevents crop loss.  
- **How**: Use Home Assistant’s `sensor` platform + `alert` integration; custom Lovelace cards.

## 4.5 Historical Analytics & Reporting

- **What**: Time-series charts (resource usage, environmental metrics) and yield logs.  
- **Why**: Optimize processes based on past performance.  
- **How**: Use `recorder/history` + Grafana add-on; card for CSV export of metrics.

## 4.6 Harvest & Yield Tracking

Non-technical users need drag-and-drop ease.  
 Log harvest dates, weights, quality notes.
- **Why**: Build per-species profiles and feed into cost models.
- **How**: Custom `vertical_farm.harvest` entity, UI form, stored in home assistant DB.

## 4.7 Custom Lovelace Cards

- **What**: Simplified configuration views, rack maps, recipe editors, analytics panels.  
- **Why**: Non-technical users need drag-and-drop ease.  
- **How**: TypeScript + HACS frontend package; follow Home Assistant UI guidelines.

## 4.8 Extensibility Hooks

- **What**: Plugin registry for external modules (vision, business systems, advanced controls).  
- **Why**: Future proof; encourage community contributions.  
- **How**: Define events and service calls under `vertical_farm_api`.

# 5. User Experience & Flows
