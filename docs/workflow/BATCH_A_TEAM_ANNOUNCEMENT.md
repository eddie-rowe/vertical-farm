# 🚀 Batch A Execution: Let's Get 20+ Issues Ready TODAY!

## The Mission

We've identified **22 "very easy" issues** that need only **minor improvements** (labels mostly). If we complete these TODAY, we'll have **20-30 issues in the Ready column** by tomorrow! 🎉

**This is a QUICK WIN. We can do this in 2 hours.**

---

## What's Needed

Each issue needs:
- ✅ **Priority label** (priority-high, priority-medium, or priority-low)
- ✅ **Size label** (size: S, M, L, or XL)
- ✅ Maybe: A quick description expansion or acceptance criteria

**Time per issue:** 5-10 minutes
**Total time:** ~2 hours across all 22

---

## How to Participate

### Option 1: Take a Few Issues (30 min)
Pick 2-3 issues and improve them. Takes ~30 min, big impact!

### Option 2: Take a Group (1 hour)
Pick all Backend Services OR all Bugs & Enhancements. Faster because they're similar!

### Option 3: Help Everywhere (2 hours)
You have 2 hours? Do all 22! You'll be a legend. 🏆

---

## The 22 Issues

### Group 1: Backend Services (15 issues)
These are all similar - add priority + size labels

```
#146 #145 #144 #143 #142 #141 #138 #137 #136 #134 #133 #132 #131 #130 #129
```

### Group 2: Bugs & Enhancements (7 issues)
Also similar - add priority + size labels

```
#123 #122 #121 #119 #118 #117 #92
```

---

## Step-by-Step: How to Help

1. **Pick 2-3+ issues** from above (or ask for assignment)

2. **For each issue:**
   - Open it in GitHub
   - Add priority label: `priority-high`, `priority-medium`, or `priority-low`
   - Add size label: `size: S`, `size: M`, `size: L`, or `size: XL`
   - (Optional) Add/expand acceptance criteria if needed
   - Comment: "Ready for review"

3. **Done!** Tech lead will review and approve in batch

4. **Celebrate!** 🎉

## Label Guidance

### Priority Labels
- `priority-high` = Blocking/critical (Bugs, urgent features)
- `priority-medium` = Important (Most services, key features)
- `priority-low` = Nice to have (Tech debt, polish)

### Size Labels
- `size: S` = Small (1-2 days)
- `size: M` = Medium (3-5 days) - Most services
- `size: L` = Large (1-2 weeks) - Complex services
- `size: XL` = Extra Large (2+ weeks) - Rare

**For Batch A:** Most will be `priority-medium` and `size: M`

---

## Quick Reference

| Issue Type | Priority Label | Size Label |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Backend Service | `priority-medium` | `size: M` |
| Important Service | `priority-high` | `size: M` or `L` |
| Bug | `priority-high` | `size: S` or `M` |
| Enhancement | `priority-medium` | `size: M` |
| Tech Debt | `priority-low` | `size: M` |

---

## What Happens After

1. **You complete improvements** → Comment "Ready for review"
2. **Tech lead reviews all 22** → Batch approval (30 min)
3. **Tech lead approves** → Adds `triage:approved` label
4. **All moved to Ready column** → Available for developers
5. **Result:** 20-30 issues ready by tomorrow! 🚀
