# 🧭 Optimal Division of Responsibilities: Next.js + FastAPI + Supabase (Hybrid Architecture)

This hybrid architecture works great across **web**, **mobile**, and **desktop**.

> Let **Supabase handle fast, low-risk interactions**, and let **FastAPI handle complex or sensitive operations**.

## 📊 Division of Responsibilities

| Type of Operation                                 | Handled By        | Why / Notes |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **User Auth (sign up, login, logout)**           | ✅ Supabase SDK   | Supabase Auth handles JWTs, sessions, password reset, etc. |
| **Session / JWT Management**                     | ✅ Supabase SDK   | Handles refresh tokens and session persistence |
| **Fetching public or user-owned data**           | ✅ Supabase SDK (with RLS) | Fastest path; use Row-Level Security for access control |
| **Realtime subscriptions (live updates)**        | ✅ Supabase Realtime | WebSocket push from Supabase; fast and scalable |
| **Inserts/updates/deletes with business logic**  | ✅ FastAPI        | Central place for validation, permission checks, logging |
| **Admin or privileged actions**                  | ✅ FastAPI        | Never expose to frontend directly |
| **Complex queries or joins**                     | ✅ FastAPI        | Abstract DB schema from frontend; Postgres views or raw SQL |
| **File uploads (images, etc.)**                  | ✅ Supabase Storage OR FastAPI | Use Supabase for user uploads; FastAPI for secure preprocessing |
| **Analytics / logs / internal metrics**          | ✅ FastAPI        | Easier to centralize and process |
| **Multi-table transactions**                     | ✅ FastAPI        | Wrap in DB transactions |
| **Custom dashboards, metrics, aggregates**       | ✅ FastAPI        | Compose and cache efficiently server-side |
| **Device discovery, IoT interactions**           | ✅ FastAPI        | Best handled by backend logic and devices |

## 🧱 Folder/Service Structure Suggestion

### ✅ FastAPI (Backend)

Handles:
- `/api/users/me` – returns enriched user profile
- `/api/tasks/` – task CRUD with validation
- `/api/admin/...` – admin-only endpoints
- `/api/devices/` – device management, discovery, etc.

🔐 Verifies Supabase JWTs via:
- Public JWKs: `https://<your-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/keys`
- Adds user context to request via dependency injection

---

### ✅ Next.js (Frontend)

Uses:
- `@supabase/auth-helpers/nextjs` for auth/session management
- `@supabase/supabase-js` for:
  - Realtime subscriptions
  - Authenticated reads with RLS
  - Simple inserts/updates

Calls **FastAPI** for:
- Anything requiring cross-table logic
- Custom APIs or secured logic

---

### ✅ Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage)

Enables:
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** to enforce per-user access
- **Postgres Functions (RPC)** for efficient direct calls
- **Realtime** for live updates
- **Storage** for user-uploaded media

---

## 🔒 Supabase RLS Example

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can access their own tasks"
  ON tasks
  FOR ALL
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

This allows safe read/write access to tasks from the frontend.

---

## 📌 Decision Tree (Frontend Developer Perspective)

🧠 **Ask yourself:**

1. **Is this data public or user-specific?**  
   → Use **Supabase directly** if RLS can safely control access.

2. **Does this write action need validation, side effects, or audit logging?**  
   → Go through **FastAPI**.

3. **Is this action admin-level or involves other users’ data?**  
   → Go through **FastAPI**.

4. **Does this require aggregating multiple tables or joining with business logic?**  
   → Go through **FastAPI**.

5. **Is this realtime or chat/live dashboard?**  
   → Use **Supabase Realtime** directly.

---

## 🔄 Example Workflows

### ➤ User Views Their Task List
**Frontend → Supabase (RLS):**
```sql
select * from tasks where user_id = auth.uid()
```

### ➤ User Creates a New Task
Frontend → FastAPI `/api/tasks/`

FastAPI does the following:
- Verifies JWT
- Validates fields
- Adds created_at, owner_id
- Inserts into Supabase

### ➤ User Watches for Realtime Task Updates
- Frontend subscribes to Supabase Realtime on `tasks` table (filtered by `user_id`)

✅ Summary
This hybrid setup gives you:

- The speed of Supabase
- The control of FastAPI
- Clean scalability for web, mobile, and desktop
