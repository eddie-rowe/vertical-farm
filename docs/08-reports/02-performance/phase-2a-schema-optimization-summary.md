  - Device counts by type (sensors, switches, lights)
  - Active schedule counts per shelf
  - Full hierarchy path strings for easy navigation
  - Last update tracking

#### `active_schedules_summary`
- **Purpose**: Real-time view of active growing schedules with progress calculations
- **Benefits**: Pre-computed progress percentages and days remaining
- **Features**:
  - Completion percentage calculations
  - Days elapsed and remaining
  - Environmental targets readily available
  - Species and recipe details joined
  - Hierarchy context included

#### `recent_sensor_summary`

- `recent_sensor_summary`: ~1-50MB for 7 days of sensor data

### Refresh Performance
- Full refresh cycle: ~100-500ms for typical farm
- Incremental updates: ~10-50ms per change
- Automated refresh threshold: 100+ database changes

### Index Storage Impact
- Additional index storage: ~10-20% of base table size
