📊 Current Usage Assessment
✅ Features You're Using Well
1. GoTrue Authentication (8/10)
✅ JWT-based authentication implemented
✅ User profiles table linking to auth.users
✅ Session management with automatic refresh
✅ Row Level Security on user-specific tables (user_home_assistant_configs, user_device_configs)
✅ Proper authentication context in frontend

2. Postgres Database (7/10)
✅ Well-designed schema with proper relationships
✅ Good use of UUIDs and foreign keys
✅ Enum types for structured data
✅ JSONB columns for flexible data storage
✅ Proper indexing strategy
✅ Temporal data handling with timestamps

3. PostgREST API (6/10)
✅ Using Supabase client for CRUD operations
✅ Async operations with proper error handling
⚠️ Custom FastAPI backend duplicating PostgREST functionality

🚨 Major Gaps & Opportunities
1. Row Level Security (2/10) - CRITICAL
Apply to supabase-rev...
.
Impact: Your data is currently not secure. Any authenticated user can access any farm data.
Solution: Enable RLS on all user-specific tables:
Apply to supabase-rev...
;

2. Supabase Realtime (1/10) - HUGE OPPORTUNITY
Currently using custom WebSockets for Home Assistant. Should leverage Supabase Realtime:
Apply to supabase-rev...
;

3. Storage API (0/10) - COMPLETELY MISSING
No image/file storage for:
Farm layout diagrams
Plant photos during growth cycles
Harvest documentation
User profile pictures

4. Edge Functions (0/10) - MISSED AUTOMATION
Perfect use cases:
Automated irrigation scheduling
Plant growth analysis
Sensor data processing
Alert notifications

🎯 Recommended Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Security Foundation (Week 1)
