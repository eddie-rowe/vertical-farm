**Date:** 2025-06-12
**Location:** /Users/eddie.rowe/Repos/vertical-farm/backend/app/tests/production_tests

## Test Overview
- **Tool:** k6
- **Scenario:** 50 virtual users, 5 minutes duration
- **Target:** Supabase-backed API (localhost:8000)

## Results Summary

| Metric                | Value         |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| Virtual Users         | 50           |
| Duration              | 5 minutes    |
| Total Requests        | 10,203       |
| DB Response Time (p95)| 110ms        |
| HTTP Duration (p95)   | 109ms        |
| Cache Hit Rate        | 0%           |
| Error Rate            | 0%           |

---

## Key Observations
- **Throughput:** ~34 requests/second sustained
- **Performance:** 95th percentile response time is 110ms (production-grade)
- **Reliability:** 0% error rate (no failed requests)
- **Caching:** Cache hit rate is 0% (may indicate endpoint/test config issue)
- **Thresholds:**
  - `cache_hit_rate` and `db_response_time` thresholds were crossed (see script for details)

---

## Recommendations
- **Caching:** Review endpoint cache headers and k6 script logic if higher cache hit rate is expected.
- **Performance:** 110ms p95 is strong; further DB/query optimization can push this lower.
- **Monitoring:** Use these numbers as a baseline for future regression checks.
