# Documentation Migration Guide

This guide helps you find documentation that was moved during the January 2025 documentation reorganization.

## üéØ Why We Reorganized

The old numbered directory structure (01-architecture/, 02-development/, etc.) was replaced with a **persona-based organization** that's more intuitive and task-oriented:

- ‚úÖ **Getting Started** - Clear entry point for new developers
- ‚úÖ **Reference** - Technical specifications and architecture
- ‚úÖ **Guides** - Task-oriented how-to documentation  
- ‚úÖ **Development** - Contribution and coding workflows
- ‚úÖ **Operations** - Deployment, monitoring, security
- ‚úÖ **Archive** - Historical reports and completed work

5. **Better Maintenance** - Logical organization for updates
6. **Improved Searchability** - More intuitive file names and locations

## üîó Broken Links?

If you find broken internal links in the codebase or documentation:

1. **Check this migration guide** for the new location
2. **Use the main navigation** in each section's README
3. **Search the documentation** using file explorer or grep
4. **Open an issue** if you can't find what you're looking for

## üìä What Improved
