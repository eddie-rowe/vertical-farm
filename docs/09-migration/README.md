## Migration Overview

The vertical-farm application supports various migration scenarios:
- Database schema updates
- Data format changes
- System architecture transitions
- Infrastructure upgrades
- Third-party service migrations

## Migration Principles

1. **Zero Downtime** - Minimize service interruption
2. **Data Integrity** - Ensure data consistency and accuracy
3. **Rollback Capability** - Ability to revert changes if needed
4. **Validation** - Comprehensive testing before and after migration
5. **Documentation** - Detailed records of all changes

## Migration Process

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Impact assessment
   - Risk analysis
   - Timeline development
   - Resource allocation

2. **Preparation Phase**
   - Backup creation
   - Test environment setup
   - Migration script development
   - Validation procedures

3. **Execution Phase**
   - Pre-migration checks
   - Migration execution
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Post-migration validation

4. **Verification Phase**
   - Data integrity checks
   - Performance validation
   - User acceptance testing
   - Documentation updates

## Quick Start

1. Review [plan.md](./plan.md) for migration procedures
2. Check specific migration types in subdirectories
3. Follow validation procedures for data integrity

## Rollback Procedures

All migrations include rollback procedures:
- Automated rollback scripts
- Data restoration procedures
- Service recovery steps
- Communication protocols
