## üéØ How to Use This Documentation

### For New Developers
1. Start with [System Architecture](./system-architecture.md) for the big picture
2. Read the architecture relevant to your role (Frontend/Backend/Full-Stack)
3. Study [Architecture Patterns](./patterns.md) to understand our conventions
4. Review [Service Layer Architecture](./service-layer.md) - this is critical!

### For Experienced Developers
- Use these documents as reference when implementing new features
- Ensure new code follows the patterns documented here
- Update documentation when making architectural changes
- Consult specific sections as needed

### For Architects & Tech Leads
- Review all documents for complete system understanding
- Use for architectural decision making
- Reference in design reviews
- Keep documentation updated with architectural evolution

## üîë Critical Concepts

### Service Layer (Most Important!)
**NEVER bypass the service layer** - All data operations MUST go through services. This is our most critical architectural pattern.

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT
const farmService = FarmService.getInstance()
const farms = await farmService.getFarmsByUser(userId)

// ‚ùå WRONG - Never direct Supabase calls
const { data } = await supabase.from('farms').select('*')
```

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
Each farm is completely isolated, ensuring:
- Data privacy between users
- Independent automation execution
- Failure isolation
- Scalable operations

### Real-time Architecture
The system uses a hybrid approach:
- **Cached data** for static/slow-changing content
- **Real-time subscriptions** for live updates
- **Service layer** for business logic

## üìã Quick Reference

### Technology Stack
| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Frontend | Next.js 15, React 19 | User interface |
| Backend | FastAPI, Python 3.13 | Business logic |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Supabase) | Data persistence |
| Edge | Cloudflare Workers | Caching & IoT |
| Real-time | Supabase Realtime | Live updates |
| Auth | Supabase Auth | Authentication |

### Key Patterns
- **Singleton Services** - `getInstance()` pattern
- **Server Components** - Default for pages
- **Row Level Security** - Database isolation
- **Event-Driven Updates** - Real-time subscriptions
- **Layered Architecture** - Clear separation of concerns

### Performance Targets
- Initial page load: < 1s
- API response time: < 200ms
- Real-time latency: < 100ms
- Cache hit ratio: > 80%

## üîÑ Document Maintenance

These documents are living references that should be updated when:
- Making significant architectural changes
- Adding new system components
- Changing core patterns
- Deprecating existing patterns
