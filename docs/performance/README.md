# Performance Documentation

This directory contains performance analysis, optimization strategies, and monitoring documentation for the vertical-farm application.

## Contents

### Performance Analysis
- **[analysis.md](./analysis.md)** - Comprehensive performance analysis and metrics
- **[optimization.md](./optimization.md)** - Performance optimization strategies and implementations

### Monitoring and Metrics
- **[monitoring/](./monitoring/)** - Performance monitoring setup and dashboards
- **[benchmarks/](./benchmarks/)** - Performance benchmarks and test results

## Performance Overview

The vertical-farm application is optimized for:
- Fast page load times (< 2 seconds)
- Efficient API response times (< 200ms)
- Optimal database query performance
- Effective caching strategies
- Scalable architecture

## Key Performance Metrics

### Frontend Performance
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- First Input Delay (FID)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)

### Backend Performance
- API response times
- Database query performance
- Memory usage
- CPU utilization
- Throughput (requests/second)

### Caching Performance
- Cache hit rates
- Cache invalidation efficiency
- CDN performance
- Browser cache effectiveness

## Optimization Strategies

1. **Frontend Optimization**
   - Code splitting and lazy loading
   - Image optimization and compression
   - Bundle size reduction
   - Service worker implementation

2. **Backend Optimization**
   - Database query optimization
   - Connection pooling
   - Async processing
   - Response compression

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Multi-layer caching (browser, CDN, application)
   - Intelligent cache invalidation
   - Edge caching with Cloudflare

## Quick Start

1. Review [analysis.md](./analysis.md) for current performance metrics
2. Check [optimization.md](./optimization.md) for improvement strategies
3. Set up monitoring using guides in [monitoring/](./monitoring/)

## Performance Testing

Regular performance testing includes:
- Load testing with realistic traffic patterns
- Stress testing for peak capacity
- Endurance testing for stability
- Spike testing for traffic surges

## Maintenance

Update performance documentation when:
- Performance metrics change significantly
- New optimization techniques are implemented
- Monitoring tools are updated
- Performance requirements are modified
