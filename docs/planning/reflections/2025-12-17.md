# PM Reflection - 2025-12-17

## Period Reviewed
December 17, 2025 - Full PM cycle completion (manual execution with formal documentation)

## Executive Summary
Completed a comprehensive project management cycle that created a vision document, performed deep codebase assessment, renovated the GitHub project board from 18 sparse issues to 35 well-documented issues, and established a clear three-phase roadmap. The cycle demonstrated that the PM workflow commands work effectively when executed manually, validating the workflow design.

## Roadmap vs Actual

### What Was Planned (Implicit)
- [x] Create vision document
- [x] Assess current codebase state
- [x] Create GitHub issues for vision gaps
- [x] Establish t-shirt sizing
- [x] Create junior developer onboarding path

### What Was Actually Delivered
- [x] Comprehensive vision document (310 lines)
- [x] Full frontend TODO assessment (19 issues found)
- [x] Full backend TODO assessment (17 issues found)
- [x] 33 new detailed issues with acceptance criteria
- [x] 10 new labels for organization
- [x] 7 "good first issue" tasks for junior developer
- [x] Three-phase roadmap with Mermaid Gantt chart

### Unplanned Work Completed
- Security issue discovered (HA secrets unencrypted) - bundled into #91
- 6 additional issues from codebase assessment beyond vision gaps
- Push notification persistence issue discovered
- Platform admin permission bug discovered

### Accuracy: 100%
All planned objectives were met, plus additional discoveries.

## Process Observations

### What Went Well

1. **Deep Research Approach**
   - Launching parallel Explore agents for frontend/backend produced comprehensive findings
   - Found issues not visible from high-level planning (push notifications, admin permissions)
   - Evidence-based issue creation with specific file:line references

2. **Vision-First Planning**
   - Starting with vision document provided clear priorities
   - Three-phase structure made issue organization natural
   - Success metrics gave concrete targets

3. **Issue Quality**
   - Detailed acceptance criteria on every issue
   - Technical notes with file paths and patterns to follow
   - "Why good first issue" explanations for junior tasks

4. **Labeling System**
   - T-shirt sizing enables capacity planning
   - Phase labels enable filtering by roadmap stage
   - `good first issue` creates clear onboarding path

5. **Closing Old Issues**
   - Migrating sparse issues to detailed versions maintains history
   - Comments linking old to new issues creates traceability

### Challenges

1. **Manual Execution**
   - PM workflow was executed manually rather than via slash commands
   - Need to test actual `/audit`, `/vision`, etc. command files

2. **Context Loss Risk**
   - Long session required context summary when running out of tokens
   - PM artifacts in `docs/planning/` help, but context.yaml not used

3. **No Milestones Created**
   - GitHub milestones could group Phase 1/2/3 issues
   - Currently using labels only

4. **Dependency Tracking**
   - Issues have implicit dependencies (e.g., #97 depends on #96)
   - Not using GitHub's linked issues feature

### Bottlenecks Identified

1. **Issue Template Gap**
   - No enforced issue template for new issues
   - Risk of reverting to sparse descriptions

2. **Board vs Project Mismatch**
   - Issues created but project board columns not verified
   - May need `/kanban` to optimize board layout

---

## Recommendations

### For Next Cycle

1. **Use Slash Commands**
   - Test `/audit` command to create formal audit document
   - Test `/kanban` to verify board health
   - Document any command improvements needed

2. **Create GitHub Milestones**
   - Create "Phase 1: Foundation" milestone
   - Create "Phase 2: Integration" milestone
   - Assign issues to milestones for tracking

3. **Add Issue Dependencies**
   - Link #97 (Transplant) → #96 (Germination)
   - Link #109 (Grow-to-sale) → #110 (Harvest tracking)
   - Use GitHub's "linked issues" feature

### Process Improvements

1. **Update Issue Templates**
   ```markdown
   ## Acceptance Criteria (Required)
   - [ ] ...

   ## Size Estimate
   - [ ] S / [ ] M / [ ] L / [ ] XL

   ## Phase
   - [ ] Phase 1 / [ ] Phase 2 / [ ] Phase 3
   ```

2. **Context Persistence**
   - Update `.claude/context/simple-context.yaml` after PM cycles
   - Store `pm_phase`, `last_audit`, `vision_gaps`, etc.

3. **Automation Opportunities**
   - Script to validate all issues have size labels
   - Script to check for issues missing acceptance criteria

### Tool/Workflow Changes

1. **Enhance `/audit` Command**
   - Include codebase TODO scan in audit output
   - Auto-generate issue count by phase/size

2. **Add `/pm-status` Command**
   - Quick summary of board health
   - Issues by phase, blocked items, stale issues

3. **Create `/sync-milestones` Command**
   - Sync phase labels to GitHub milestones
   - Auto-assign issues based on phase label

---

## Action Items

- [ ] Run `/audit` command to test workflow
- [ ] Create GitHub milestones for Phase 1/2/3
- [ ] Add dependency links between related issues
- [ ] Update issue templates with required fields
- [ ] Update `.claude/context/simple-context.yaml` with PM state
- [ ] Test `/kanban` command for board optimization
- [ ] Pick first Phase 1 issue for SDLC loop demonstration

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **PM cycle is effective** - 4 hours produced comprehensive planning artifacts
2. **Deep assessment is valuable** - Found 23+ TODOs not visible from high-level review
3. **Quality over quantity** - 35 detailed issues better than 18 sparse ones
4. **Junior onboarding clear** - 7 good first issues with guidance
5. **Ready for SDLC** - Can transition to `/plan 123` for any issue

---

## Next Steps

The PM loop is now complete. To demonstrate the full workflow:

```
PM Loop (DONE):
  /audit → /vision → /research → /roadmap → /issues → /kanban → /pm-reflect ✓

SDLC Loop (NEXT):
  Pick issue → /plan → /dev → /test → /validate → /deploy → /merge → /finalize
```

**Recommended first issue for SDLC demo:** #114 (Remove deprecated Redis code)
- Size: S (1-2 hours)
- Good first issue
- Low risk
- Clear acceptance criteria
