All necessary changes for Datadog instrumentation have been made:

Frontend (Next.js)
Datadog RUM is initialized globally via a new datadog-init.ts file, imported in your root layout.
.env.local is set up for your RUM application/client tokens.

Backend (FastAPI)
Datadog tracing and logging are initialized in datadog_init.py and imported in main.py.
Backend is configured to run with ddtrace-run for full APM support.
.env is set up for Datadog service/env/version tags.

Docker Compose
A datadog agent service is added, with all required environment variables and volumes.
The backend service is configured to send traces/logs/metrics to the Datadog agent.


What you need to do:
Add your real Datadog API key to your environment (e.g., in a .env file at the project root):
Apply to datadog-inte...
your_real_datadog_api_key
Add your Datadog RUM application and client tokens to frontend/.env.local.
Rebuild and restart your Docker Compose stack:
Apply to datadog-inte...
build
Youâ€™ll now have unified metrics, traces, and logs from both frontend and backend in Datadog!
If you want to add custom metrics, advanced logging, or trace propagation between frontend and backend, just let me know!
