# Deployment Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for deploying and managing the Vertical Farm application across different environments and platforms.

## üìÅ Deployment Documents

### Core Deployment Guides
- **[cloudflare-caching-guide.md](./cloudflare-caching-guide.md)** - Comprehensive caching implementation with Cloudflare Cache API
- **[cloudflare-config.md](./cloudflare-config.md)** - Cloudflare configuration settings and rules
- **[github-actions.md](./github-actions.md)** - CI/CD workflows and automation

### Platform-Specific Deployment
- **[render-deployment.md](./render-deployment.md)** - Deployment to Render platform
- **[docker-deployment.md](./docker-deployment.md)** - Docker containerization and deployment

## üöÄ Deployment Architecture

The Vertical Farm application uses a multi-tier deployment strategy:

### Production Environment
- **Frontend**: Deployed to Render with Next.js optimization
- **Backend**: FastAPI deployed to Render with auto-scaling
- **Database**: Supabase managed PostgreSQL
- **CDN**: Cloudflare for global content delivery and caching
- **Monitoring**: Datadog for observability and alerting

### Development Environment
- **Local**: Docker Compose for full-stack development
- **Testing**: Automated testing in GitHub Actions
- **Staging**: Branch-based deployments for testing

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### Three-Layer Caching Strategy
1. **Cloudflare Edge Cache**: Global edge caching (5 min - 1 year TTL)
2. **Backend Cache Middleware**: Application-level caching with ETag support
3. **Frontend Cache**: Client-side caching with real-time invalidation

### Expected Performance Improvements
- **3x faster** response times for cached content
- **90%+ cache hit rate** for static assets
- **60%+ cache hit rate** for API endpoints
- **Reduced origin server load** by 70%+

## üîß Quick Start Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
# Start full development environment
docker-compose up -d

# Access services
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend: http://localhost:8000
# Database: Supabase cloud instance
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy via GitHub Actions
git push origin main

# Manual deployment to Render
render deploy --service frontend
render deploy --service backend
```

## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] Security configurations verified
- [ ] Performance testing completed

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Cache performance validated
- [ ] Security scans completed

## üîç Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics
- **Response Time**: Target <200ms for API endpoints
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Target >80% for cacheable content
- **Error Rate**: Target <1% for all endpoints
- **Uptime**: Target 99.9% availability

### Monitoring Tools
- **Datadog**: Application performance monitoring
- **Cloudflare Analytics**: CDN and caching metrics
- **Render Metrics**: Platform-specific monitoring
- **Supabase Dashboard**: Database performance
