---

## 2. Systematic Project Audit for Each Component

### 1. **Postgres (Database)**
- **Implementation:**  
  - Core database for all app data.
  - Schema, migrations, and DDL in `supabase/migrations/` and `docs/database-schema.md`.
  - RLS (Row Level Security) policies, triggers, and functions are present.
- **Improvements:**  
  - Already follows best practices: UUID PKs, RLS, indexes, constraints.
  - Continue to document schema and migrations.
- **Supabase UI Verification:**  
  - Use **Table Editor** in Studio to view tables, relationships, and RLS status.
  - Use **SQL Editor** to run schema and function verification queries.

---

### 2. **Studio (Dashboard)**
- **Implementation:**  
  - Enabled in `supabase/config.toml` (`[studio] enabled = true`).
  - Used for local management and development.
- **Improvements:**  
  - None needed; Studio is enabled and accessible.
- **Supabase UI Verification:**  
  - Access via `http://localhost:54323` (or your configured port).
  - Confirm you can view tables, storage, auth, and logs.

---

### 3. **GoTrue (Auth)**
- **Implementation:**  
  - Configured in `supabase/config.toml` (`[auth] enabled = true`).
  - Used for all authentication flows (sign up, sign in, password reset, OAuth).
  - RLS policies and backend code enforce user context.
  - Frontend and backend use `supabase.auth` methods.
- **Improvements:**  
  - Consider enabling MFA for production.
  - Review password and signup policies for security.
- **Supabase UI Verification:**  
  - Use **Auth** tab in Studio to view/manage users, providers, and settings.
  - Test sign up/in flows and check user records.

---

### 4. **PostgREST (API)**
- **Implementation:**  
  - All CRUD operations migrated to Supabase PostgREST.
  - Frontend and backend use `.from()` and `.rpc()` for direct DB access.
  - Custom functions exposed via RPC.
  - FastAPI endpoints for CRUD have been removed or minimized.
- **Improvements:**  
  - Continue to migrate any remaining custom endpoints to PostgREST where possible.
  - Use RPC for complex logic.
- **Supabase UI Verification:**  
  - Use **API Docs** in Studio to see auto-generated REST endpoints.
  - Test endpoints with the built-in API explorer.

---

### 5. **Realtime (API & Subscriptions)**
- **Implementation:**  
  - Enabled in `supabase/config.toml` (`[realtime] enabled = true`).
  - Real-time subscriptions in frontend via hooks/contexts.
  - Migrations enable real-time on key tables.
- **Improvements:**  
  - Monitor for unnecessary subscriptions to avoid performance issues.
- **Supabase UI Verification:**  
  - Use **Logs** in Studio to see real-time events.
  - Use **Table Editor** to check which tables are enabled for real-time.

---

### 6. **Storage API**
- **Implementation:**  
  - Enabled in `supabase/config.toml` (`[storage] enabled = true`).
  - Buckets created via migrations for user uploads, documentation, photos, manuals, and backups.
  - RLS policies for fine-grained access.
  - Utility functions and triggers for file management.
  - Used in frontend for uploads and in backend for references.
- **Improvements:**  
  - Periodically run cleanup functions for orphaned files.
  - Monitor storage quotas and usage.
- **Supabase UI Verification:**  
  - Use **Storage** tab in Studio to view buckets, files, and policies.
  - Test uploads and access control.

---

### 7. **Deno (Edge Functions)**
- **Implementation:**  
  - Edge runtime and functions enabled in `supabase/config.toml` (`[edge_runtime] enabled = true`).
  - Functions in `supabase/functions/` for background processing, queue scheduling, and cron jobs.
  - Used for background tasks, queue management, and integration with Home Assistant.
- **Improvements:**  
  - Monitor function logs for errors.
  - Use environment variables for secrets.
- **Supabase UI Verification:**  
  - Use **Edge Functions** tab in Studio to view, deploy, and test functions.
  - Check logs and execution history.

---

### 8. **postgres-meta (Database Management)**
- **Implementation:**  
  - Not directly referenced, but all migrations, schema changes, and management align with postgres-meta capabilities.
  - Use of migrations, schema files, and config.
- **Improvements:**  
  - Continue to use migrations for all schema changes.
- **Supabase UI Verification:**  
  - Use **Table Editor** and **SQL Editor** in Studio for schema management.
  - Use **Migrations** tab if available.

---

### 9. **Supavisor (Connection Pooler)**
- **Implementation:**  
  - Pooler logic in backend (`database_service.py`) converts direct DB URLs to Supavisor pooler URLs for query caching.
  - Health checks and integration tests for pooler and caching.
  - Production testing scripts for query caching and failover.
- **Improvements:**  
  - Monitor pooler usage and cache hit rates in production.
  - Enable `[db.pooler]` in config for local dev if needed.
- **Supabase UI Verification:**  
  - Use **Project Settings > Database** in Studio to view pooler status and connection strings.
  - Monitor metrics for connection pool usage.

---

### 10. **Kong (API Gateway)**
- **Implementation:**  
  - **Not directly referenced** in codebase or config.
  - Supabase Cloud uses Kong internally, but self-hosted/local setups may not expose it.
- **Improvements:**  
  - If you need custom API gateway features (rate limiting, custom routing), consider deploying Kong or using Supabase Cloud.
- **Supabase UI Verification:**  
  - Not directly visible; managed by Supabase in cloud deployments.

---

## 3. Additional Features & Best Practices

- **RLS Policies:**  
  - Extensively used for all sensitive tables and storage buckets.
  - Custom policies for user, farm, and admin access.
- **Database Functions & Triggers:**  
  - Utility functions for storage, background tasks, and statistics.
  - Triggers for updating references and cleaning up data.
- **Performance Indexes:**  
  - Indexes on all major tables and foreign keys.
- **Testing & Verification Scripts:**  
  - `scripts/verify-supabase-features.sql` for automated feature checks.
  - Manual and integration test scripts for health, caching, and background processing.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Markdown docs for migration strategy, schema, and PostgREST usage.
