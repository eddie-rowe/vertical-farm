# /kanban - Optimize Project Board

Analyze and optimize the GitHub project board for effective work management.

[Extended thinking: This workflow analyzes the project board state, identifies issues needing attention (stale, blocked, misprioritized), and suggests or performs optimizations to keep work flowing smoothly.]

## Usage
```
/kanban
```

## Execution

When invoked with `/kanban`, execute these steps:

1. **Begin Board Optimization**
   **Output:**
   ```

   ```

2. **Gather Board State**
   ```bash
   # Get all open issues with details
   gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels,milestone,createdAt,updatedAt,assignees --limit 100

   # Get open PRs
   gh pr list --state open --json number,title,createdAt,updatedAt,isDraft,reviewDecision
   ```

3. **Analysis Categories**

   | Category | Criteria | Action |
   |----------|----------|--------|
   | **Stale Issues** | No activity 14+ days | Close, update, or reassign |
   | **Blocked Items** | "blocked" label or mentions | Resolve or document |
   | **Priority Inversion** | Low priority getting attention over high | Rebalance focus |
   | **WIP Overload** | Too many in progress | Complete before starting new |
   | **Orphaned Items** | No milestone or labels | Categorize or close |
