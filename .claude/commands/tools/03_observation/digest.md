# /digest - Weekly Observation Digest

Generate a weekly synthesis of production observability data that feeds into the PM loop. This is the key handoff document from the Observation Loop to the PM Loop.

## Usage
```
/digest
```

## Examples
```
/digest
```

## Execution

When invoked with `/digest`, execute these steps:

1. **Begin Digest Generation**
   **Output:**
   ```
   🔍 Generating observation digest...
   📊 Aggregating metrics from the past 7 days
   ```

2. **Gather System Health Data**
   ```
   # Check current system status
   # Query Datadog for service health metrics
   # Aggregate error rates and latency trends

   # If Datadog API not available, gather from:
   # - Recent deployment logs
   # - GitHub Actions status
   # - Supabase logs
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   📈 System Health:
     Services Healthy: {count}/{total}
     Overall Status: GREEN/YELLOW/RED
   ```

3. **Aggregate SLO Metrics**
   ```
   # Query SLO compliance for all services
   # Calculate error budget consumption
   # Identify services approaching budget exhaustion

   # Key SLOs to track:
   # - API latency p95 < 200ms
   # - Frontend FCP < 1.5s
   # - Error rate < 0.1%
   # - Uptime > 99.9%
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   📊 SLO Status:
     Services in Budget: {count}/{total}
     Error Budget Consumed: {percentage}%
     At-Risk Services: {list or "None"}
   ```

4. **Analyze Performance Trends**
   ```
   # Compare this week vs. 4-week average
   # Use p50, p95, p99 percentiles
   # Flag changes > 2 standard deviations

   # Metrics to track:
   # - API response times by endpoint
   # - Database query latency
   # - Edge function execution time
   # - Frontend bundle performance
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   📈 Performance Trends (WoW):
     API Latency: {value}ms ({change})
     DB Queries: {value}ms ({change})
     Frontend FCP: {value}s ({change})

   ⚠️ Significant Changes:
     - {metric}: {description of change}
   ```

5. **Gather User Experience Insights**
   ```
   # Query RUM data if available
   # Analyze session completion rates
   # Identify top user friction points

   # Key UX metrics:
   # - Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
   # - Session error rates
   # - Feature usage patterns
   # - User journey completion
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   👤 User Experience:
     Session Error Rate: {percentage}%
     Journey Completion: {percentage}%
     Core Web Vitals: {pass/fail}

   Top Friction Points:
     1. {page/feature}: {issue}
     2. {page/feature}: {issue}
   ```

6. **Review Recent Incidents**
   ```
   # Check for incidents in the past week
   # Summarize impact and resolution
   # Link to postmortems if available
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   🚨 Incidents This Week: {count}
     {If any:}
     - INC-{id}: {brief description} - {status}
   ```

7. **Generate Recommended Actions**
   ```
   # Based on trends and insights, suggest actions
   # Categorize by: Performance, Reliability, UX, Security
   # Frame as "Consider:" to leave decision to PM
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   💡 Recommended Actions:
     - Consider: {action based on trends}
     - Consider: {action based on incidents}
     - Consider: {action based on UX insights}
   ```

8. **Create Digest Document**
   ```
   # Generate markdown document
   DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
   mkdir -p docs/observation/digests
   # Save to docs/observation/digests/YYYY-MM-DD.md
   ```

9. **Complete Digest**
   **Output:**
   ```
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ✅ Observation Digest Complete
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   📁 Report saved: docs/observation/digests/YYYY-MM-DD.md
   📂 Context updated for PM loop

   💡 Next steps:
      • '/audit' - Run PM audit with digest insights
      • '/status' - Check current real-time health
      • '/autoobs' - Run full observation sweep
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

## Data Sources

### Primary (if Datadog configured)
- APM metrics for latency and throughput
- RUM for user experience metrics
- Infrastructure metrics for system health
- Log aggregations for error patterns

### Fallback (if Datadog unavailable)
- GitHub Actions workflow runs
- Supabase logs and metrics
- Recent deployment history
- Manual service health checks

## Integration

### Feeds Into
- `/audit` - PM audit reads recent digests to inform planning
- `/vision` - Production insights guide product direction
- `/roadmap` - Priorities informed by real-world data

### Generated By
- `/autoobs` - Includes digest as final step
- Can also be run standalone weekly
