Generate weekly changelog from GitHub activity:

[Extended thinking: This workflow creates a changelog to track progress and maintain momentum. Per Linear Method, publishing updates regularly combats the psychological challenge when momentum feels slow.]

**Gather Activity Data**
Collect GitHub activity from the past 7 days:

```bash
# Merged PRs (past 7 days)
gh pr list --state merged --limit 30 --json number,title,mergedAt,labels,author

# Closed issues (past 7 days)
gh issue list --state closed --limit 50 --json number,title,closedAt,labels

# Recent commits
git log --since="7 days ago" --oneline --format="%h %s" | head -30

# Check for releases
gh release list --limit 1
```

**Categorize by Type**
Group items by label/prefix:
- **Features**: `feat:` prefix, `enhancement` label
- **Fixes**: `fix:` prefix, `bug` label
- **Improvements**: `refactor:`, `chore:`, `docs:` prefixes

**Calculate Metrics**
- Total PRs merged this week
- Total issues closed this week
- Lines added/removed (if available)
- Compare to previous week if data exists

**Generate Output**
Create `docs/changelogs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown

*"At times, when you feel things not moving as fast, you can look back
at how much you achieved already." - Linear Method*

*Generated by /changelog command*
```

**Create Directory if Needed**
Ensure `docs/changelogs/` directory exists before writing.

**Linear Method Principle**
This changelog serves multiple purposes:
1. **Weekly accountability** - Visible record of shipping
2. **Combat slow-progress feelings** - Tangible proof of momentum
3. **Stakeholder communication** - Share progress externally
4. **Historical record** - Track patterns over time

Include the Linear Method quote to reinforce the purpose.
