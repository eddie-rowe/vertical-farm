Review PM process effectiveness and identify improvements:

[Extended thinking: This workflow analyzes the PM loop's performance by examining cycle times, roadmap accuracy, and process bottlenecks. It generates insights and recommendations for improving the planning process.]

**Gather Historical Data**
Collect data for analysis:

```bash
# Closed issues with timeline
gh issue list --state closed --limit 50 --json number,title,createdAt,closedAt,labels,milestone

# Merged PRs with timeline
gh pr list --state merged --limit 30 --json number,title,createdAt,mergedAt,additions,deletions

# Recent commits
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits --jq '.[0:30] | .[] | {sha: .sha[0:7], date: .commit.author.date, message: .commit.message}'
```

**Read Previous Planning Artifacts**
- Read recent audits from `docs/planning/audits/`
- Read `docs/planning/roadmap.md` for planned vs actual
- Read `docs/planning/vision.md` for goal alignment
- Read previous reflections from `docs/planning/reflections/`

**Analysis Dimensions**

1. **Cycle Time Analysis**
   - Average time from issue creation to close
   - Average time from PR open to merge
   - Identify outliers (very fast or very slow)

2. **Roadmap Accuracy**
   - Compare planned milestones to actual delivery
   - Identify items that slipped or were cut
   - Note unplanned work that was added

3. **Process Bottlenecks**
   - Where do issues get stuck?
   - What causes delays?
   - What patterns lead to rework?

4. **Planning Quality**
   - Were issue descriptions sufficient?
   - Did acceptance criteria capture requirements?
   - Were estimates accurate?

5. **Tool Effectiveness**
   - Are PM commands being used?
   - What's working well?
   - What's friction in the process?

6. **Momentum Health (Linear Method)**
   - Daily shipping frequency (commits, PRs merged)
   - Items stuck > 3 days without progress
   - Decision paralysis indicators
   - Velocity trend (accelerating/decelerating/steady)

**Momentum Score Calculation:**
- **HIGH**: Daily commits, issues closed within cycle, no blockers
- **MEDIUM**: Weekly shipping, some items slow, minor blockers
- **LOW**: Multi-week stalls, many stuck items, major blockers

Key insight from Linear: *"Startups rarely die because they made too much
progress, but they do die when they move too slow or give up."*

**Generate Insights**
Use Task tool with subagent_type="business-analyst":
- Prompt: "Analyze this project management data and identify:
  1. Trends in cycle time and throughput
  2. Patterns in what gets delivered vs planned
  3. Process improvement opportunities
  4. Recommendations for the next planning cycle

  Data: [provide collected metrics]"

**Output Format**
Create `docs/planning/reflections/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown
