# Issue Finalization Workflow

Complete the development lifecycle by documenting work, creating logs, and closing GitHub issues with comprehensive notes.

## Purpose

The finalization workflow ensures that:
- All work is properly documented
- Development journey is captured in prompting logs
- GitHub issues are closed with detailed summaries
- Context is archived for future reference
- The system is ready for the next issue

## Usage

```bash
make finalize ISSUE=123
```

This command will:
1. Generate a prompting log in `.claude/logs/YYYY-MM-DD/issue-123.md`
2. Create a comprehensive closing comment for the GitHub issue
3. Archive the current context to `.claude/context/archive/`
4. Invoke Claude to update documentation and close the issue
5. Reset context for the next development cycle

## Prompting Log Format

Each prompting log captures:
- **Prompt**: Original issue description
- **Todos**: Tasks that were generated and completed
- **Summary**: What was implemented, including commits and files
- **Next Steps**: Follow-up work or improvements to consider
- **Follow up prompt**: Suggested prompt for continuing the work

## GitHub Closing Comment

The generated closing comment includes:
- Implementation summary with commit count and files changed
- Key files modified
- Validation status
- Links to prompting logs and archived context
- Next steps for deployment

## Workflow Components

### 1. Prompting Log Generator (`prompting-log.sh`)
- Extracts information from git history
- Creates structured markdown logs
- Archives context automatically
- Generates closing comments

### 2. Finalization Workflow (`issue-finalize.md`)
- Updates relevant documentation
- Creates comprehensive logs
- Closes GitHub issues
- Archives all artifacts

### 3. Context Archival
- Saves current context to archive
- Preserves decision history
- Maintains audit trail
- Enables future reference

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Complete Documentation**: Every issue has a full record
‚úÖ **Knowledge Preservation**: Decisions and learnings are captured
‚úÖ **Clean Handoff**: Issues are closed with all necessary information
‚úÖ **Ready for Next**: Context is reset for the next issue
‚úÖ **Team Visibility**: Everyone can see what was done and why

## Example Output

### Prompting Log Example
```markdown
# Issue 123 - Prompting Log
Date: 2024-01-15

Ready for merge and deployment
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

The finalization step completes the full development cycle:

```
plan ‚Üí dev ‚Üí test ‚Üí validate ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí finalize
```

After finalization:
- The issue is closed with full documentation
- Context is cleared for the next issue
- Prompting logs are available for reference
- Team has complete visibility of work done

## Best Practices

1. **Always finalize before starting new work** - Ensures clean context
2. **Review the prompting log** - Verify it captures key decisions
3. **Check the closing comment** - Ensure it's comprehensive
4. **Archive important decisions** - They're valuable for future reference
5. **Use follow-up prompts** - They guide future enhancements

## Troubleshooting

If finalization fails:
- Check that you're on the correct branch
- Ensure the issue number is correct
- Verify git history is available
- Make sure context file exists

To manually reset context:
```bash
.claude/hooks/prompting-log.sh reset
```

## Summary

The finalization workflow ensures every piece of work is properly documented, closed, and archived. This creates a valuable knowledge base of development decisions and enables smooth transitions between issues.
