## Report Types

### Reflections (`/reflect`)
Development pattern analysis reports generated by the `/reflect` command.

**Contains:**
- Error pattern analysis
- Code quality assessments
- Workflow optimization suggestions
- Action items for improvement

**Generated by:** `/reflect [commits] [scope]`

**Naming convention:** `YYYY-MM-DD-reflection.md`

### Reviews (Future)
Code review reports for pull requests.

### Audits (Future)

## Usage

Reports are automatically generated when running analysis commands. To generate a new reflection report:

```bash
/reflect           # Analyze last 10 commits
/reflect 20        # Analyze last 20 commits
/reflect 10 typescript  # Focus on TypeScript changes
```

## Retention

Reports are kept indefinitely for historical reference. Consider archiving or removing reports older than 6 months if the directory grows too large.
