# Vertical Farm Platform

A full-stack, AI-augmented platform for managing, simulating, and optimizing vertical farming operations.  

This project combines a modern Next.js frontend, a Python FastAPI backend, automation/testing agents, and human-in-the-loop workflows to deliver a robust, extensible solution for smart agriculture.

The end goal of this project is to have a gamified vertical farming app that includes a full Grow Operations suite of features and a full Business Operations suite of features. Using the data from this suite, a user is given a holistic overview of the business and recommendations for the best place to apply their focus.
